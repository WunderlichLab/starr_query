# Large-scale Enhancer Screen Database

This project aims to develop a database to systematically capture and query data from a large-scale enhancer screen.   

Enhancers are sequences that promote the expression of the associated gene sequences. The underlying dataset utilizes STARR-seq to measure Drosophila enhancer activity and gene expression across experimental conditions exploring regulatory mechanisms in immune responses. At the moment, the dataset provided by the Wunderlich lab contains data from three experimental conditions:  
- Control
- Hormone Treatment (20E)
- Immune Treatment (HKSM with 20E)
  
Integrating information regarding: 
- Genomic Enhancer Coordinates
- Associated Genes
- Gene Expression Changes (LogFC)
- Immune Pathway Annotations
- Transcription Factor Motifs
- Enhancer Activity Scores
  
Our database will incorporate this data to allow researchers easy access and retrieval of enhancer-gene interactions. It will be designed for supporting structured queries on enhancer activity, gene expression patterns, and motif enrichment.
